# OpenVINO™ Toolkit

The OpenVINO™ (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization) toolkit is a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline the deployment of high-performance deep learning inference applications. Developed by Intel, OpenVINO™ helps developers harness the full potential of Intel hardware for AI, including CPUs, GPUs, VPUs, and FPGAs.

Google Colab is an excellent platform for developing and testing OpenVINO™ projects. Follow these steps to set up and run OpenVINO™ on Colab:

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Install the necessary dependencies, including OpenVINO™ and CMake.
   - Ensure your Colab environment is updated.

2. **Download OpenVINO Toolkit:**
   - Download and unzip the OpenVINO™ toolkit to access the necessary files and resources.

3. **Clone the OpenVINO Notebooks Repository:**
   - Clone the OpenVINO™ notebooks repository from GitHub to access sample notebooks and project templates.

4. **Navigate to the Notebook Directory:**
   - Change to the directory containing the sample notebooks to prepare for running them.

5. **List Available Notebooks:**
   - List the available notebooks in the directory to choose a sample notebook to run.

6. **Optional - Set Up Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2):**
   - If using Intel's Neural Compute Stick 2, install additional dependencies and set up the device. Note that Colab does not natively support USB devices, so this is only for local development.

7. **Running Inference with OpenVINO™:**
   - Open a sample notebook and run inference using the OpenVINO™ toolkit. Follow the instructions provided in the sample notebooks for guidance.

By following these steps, you can effectively develop and test your OpenVINO™ projects on Google Colab, leveraging the cloud-based resources for deep learning inference applications.

## Results from MonoDepth Estimation

> Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating scene depth using a single image.
> It has many potential applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, medical imaging and autonomous systems.
> This tutorial uses a neural network model called MiDaS, which was developed by the Embodied AI Foundation.
